<h4>Say what? NOOOO!</h4>
<p>
    How frustraiting is it when you are working with someone else's asset and they don't 
    have a good API? Example, you need to modify some content, for some reason (probably a
    designer), and said content is provided ansynchronously...and you don't control it.
</p>
<p>
    Hopefully there is some event that triggers, like $('document').on('muh-code-is-ready', doStuff). 
    Ah, but not today. Well, damn. No doc.ready, or window.load is going to get you out of this. 
    I know; you're thinking about setTimeOut, but please don't.

    Instead consider the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Events/Mutation_events" target="_blank">
            DOM muation events, which kind of suck, but are easy to use.
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver" target="_blank">
            DOM muation observers, which are no kinds of suck, but are a pain to use.
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/matt-mendonca/jQuery-Insert-Mutation-Listener" target="_blank">
            My plugin, which is really easy to use, but kind of sucks at the moment (when I get time
            it will make it better, pinky promise).
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Please note, that neither Mutation Events, nor Mutation Observers have solid browser support.
    In short, do not rely on them for functionality, rather use them for progressive enhancement.

    Lets take a quick overview of each.

<h4>DOM Mutation Events</h4>
<p>
    Mutation Events have been around the longest. Since they are an event you <em>can</em> bind to them
    like other events:
